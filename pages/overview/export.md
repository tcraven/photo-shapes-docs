# Exporting Shapes And Textures

Shapes and their textures can be exported in the widely supported GLTF format, and
imported into other 3D software, such as Blender.

1. Click the Export GLTF button. The GLTF file is downloaded to the user's computer
2. Open Blender and choose File > Import > glTF 2.0
3. Choose the downloaded file in the import dialog
4. The shape is imported into Blender. The shape tree is intact
5. Textures are included, and display exactly the same as in the Photo Shapes user interface
