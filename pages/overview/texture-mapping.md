# Texture Mapping From Photographs

Once a model and cameras fit the photographs, Photo Shapes can project textures from
photographs onto the shapes. The process works as follows:

1.  The user selects the photographs to use and the shapes for which textures are to
    be rendered. Photo Shapes only projects texture from a photo onto parts of shapes
    that are visible in that photo
2.  With many photos selected as textures, Photo Shapes chooses the best photo to use
    for each shape face, preferring photos where that shape face is most prominent
3.  The more photos that are used, and the better the photo quality, the better the
    textured result.
4.  The textured view of shapes can be shown superimposed on photographs
5.  The generated texture images are easy to use as a starting point for creating clean
    textures for a model
