# Optimizing Shape Parameters

The position, rotation and size parameters of shapes can also be optimized to give the
best possible fit across all photographs in the project.

The following screenshots demonstrate finding the position and dimensions of a chimney
shape using the Optimize Expressions function:

1.  The Chimney Left box shape is defined in terms of the four expressions: chmLength,
    chmWidth, chmHeight, and chmOffsetX
2.  Eleven photo match lines across five photographs give information about the size
    and position of the chimney shape
3.  The user selects the expressions for optimization using the yellow lightning buttons
4.  Photo Shapes optimizes the expression values, and determines the position and
    dimensions of the chimney
